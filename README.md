<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>
  This repository is part of my developer's work at the Philippine National Police Academy (www.pnpa.edu.ph) and is just a way to speed up setting up my working environment with NodeJS projects that utilize Test-Driven Development. This is basically a scaffold with Jest Testing Library (https://jestjs.io/) pre-installed.

<h2>Installation &amp; Configuration</h2>
<p>
  Just clone all this repository and you are good to go.
